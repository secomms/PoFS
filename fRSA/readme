Simulator the fRSA-II protocol

Run main.py to simulate creation of blocks in the blockchain, using the fRSA-II protocol.

NOTE #1: This is intended to be a proof-of-concept implementation, hence, we do not claim any type of cryptographic security for the implementation of the employed algorithms.
NOTE #2: The code simulates only the logical steps to create blocks, and not the interaction between miners 
NOTE #3: The code works only if the folder Blocks exists
